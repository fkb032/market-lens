# Code Passport

An automated skill that audits your codebase for market-specific cultural, UX, and product issues. Built from 4+ years of building products in Brazil (fraud prevention, real estate technology, ML-powered content moderation) and hard-won lessons about what breaks when you ship Western defaults into emerging markets. Goes beyond localization into payments, trust signals, identity verification, communication patterns, compliance, and more.

**Website:** [codepassport.ai](https://codepassport.ai)

Currently supports **Brazil**. By [Farhan Khalaf](https://linkedin.com/in/farhankhalaf).

## What It Checks

Code Passport scans your actual codebase (templates, components, payment integrations, forms, validators, i18n files, copy, CSS, config) and produces a scored report. Every finding has a file path, line number, and specific fix recommendation.

**15 audit categories for Brazil:**

| Category | Example Checks |
|----------|---------------|
| Payments | Pix, credit card installments (parcelamento), boleto, Pix discount |
| Payment Infrastructure | Brazilian gateway (Pagarme, Stone, Mercado Pago), anti-fraud, chargebacks |
| Trust Signals | CNPJ in footer, Reclame Aqui reference, nota fiscal integration |
| Identity and CPF | CPF field at checkout, mod-11 checksum validation, third-party verification |
| Communication | WhatsApp contact, WhatsApp support channel, platform leakage strategy |
| Copy and Tone | Brazilian Portuguese (not European PT or Spanish), warm informal tone |
| Legal and LGPD | Cookie consent (granular), account deletion, data portability, DPO contact |
| Currency and Formatting | R$ formatting, comma as decimal separator, DD/MM/YYYY dates |
| Social and Cultural | WhatsApp sharing, Brazilian holiday calendar, Southern Hemisphere seasons |
| Forms and Data | CEP auto-fill, complemento field, Brazilian phone format, name conventions |
| Localization | pt-BR locale, hreflang tags, Portuguese error/404/empty states |
| Low-Bandwidth Resilience | JS bundle size, image optimization, CDN, offline handling, Save-Data header |
| SMS and Verification | SMS OTP, phone-as-identifier, Brazilian carrier support |
| Social Login | Facebook/Instagram OAuth, social account age as trust signal |
| Identity Exposure | Optional profile photos, public name display, block functionality |

**Two scores:**
- **Main Score** (X/100): Overall Brazil market readiness
- **Low-Bandwidth Score** (X/100): How well the product works on weak 3G connections and budget Android devices

Copy the skill folder into your project's `.claude/skills/` directory:

```bash
mkdir -p your-project/.claude/skills/code-passport
cp code-passport/skill/SKILL.md your-project/.claude/skills/code-passport/
```

## Usage

Open your AI coding assistant in the project directory and run:

```
/code-passport brazil
```

The skill scans your codebase and produces a report saved to `outputs/code-passport/audit-brazil-[date].md`.

## Example Output

See [example-output.md](code-passport/skill/example-output.md) for a full sample audit report against a fictional e-commerce codebase.

## Contributing

Code Passport's value comes from practitioner knowledge — people who've shipped products in a specific market and know what breaks. If that's you, we want your expertise.

To contribute market knowledge, clone this repo and run the `/contribute-codepassport` skill in Claude Code. It walks you through what we need. You don't have to be an expert on everything. Skip sections you're unsure about, and others can fill the gaps.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full guide.
