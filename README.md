# Market Lens

An automated skill that audits your codebase for market-specific cultural, UX, and product issues. Goes beyond localization into payments, trust signals, identity verification, communication patterns, compliance, and more.

Currently supports **Brazil**.

## What It Checks

Market Lens scans your actual codebase (templates, components, payment integrations, forms, validators, i18n files, copy, CSS, config) and produces a scored report. Every finding has a file path, line number, and specific fix recommendation.

**15 audit categories for Brazil:**

| Category | Example Checks |
|----------|---------------|
| Payments | Pix, credit card installments (parcelamento), boleto, Pix discount |
| Payment Infrastructure | Brazilian gateway (Pagarme, Stone, Mercado Pago), anti-fraud, chargebacks |
| Trust Signals | CNPJ in footer, Reclame Aqui reference, nota fiscal integration |
| Identity and CPF | CPF field at checkout, mod-11 checksum validation, third-party verification |
| Communication | WhatsApp contact, WhatsApp support channel, platform leakage strategy |
| Copy and Tone | Brazilian Portuguese (not European PT or Spanish), warm informal tone |
| Legal and LGPD | Cookie consent (granular), account deletion, data portability, DPO contact |
| Currency and Formatting | R$ formatting, comma as decimal separator, DD/MM/YYYY dates |
| Social and Cultural | WhatsApp sharing, Brazilian holiday calendar, Southern Hemisphere seasons |
| Forms and Data | CEP auto-fill, complemento field, Brazilian phone format, name conventions |
| Localization | pt-BR locale, hreflang tags, Portuguese error/404/empty states |
| Low-Bandwidth Resilience | JS bundle size, image optimization, CDN, offline handling, Save-Data header |
| SMS and Verification | SMS OTP, phone-as-identifier, Brazilian carrier support |
| Social Login | Facebook/Instagram OAuth, social account age as trust signal |
| Identity Exposure | Optional profile photos, public name display, block functionality |

**Two scores:**
- **Main Score** (X/100): Overall Brazil market readiness
- **Low-Bandwidth Score** (X/100): How well the product works on weak 3G connections and budget Android devices

## Install
