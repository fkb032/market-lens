## Critical Issues (Must Fix)

### 1. No Pix payment integration
**Category:** Payments
**File:** src/lib/payments/gateway.ts:23
**Finding:** Payment gateway only configures Stripe with USD credit card processing. No Pix integration found anywhere in the codebase.
**Fix:** Integrate Pix via a Brazilian payment gateway (Pagarme, Stone, or Mercado Pago). Pix is the most-used payment method in Brazil with 150M+ users. Without it, you're losing a significant share of potential transactions.

### 2. No CPF field at checkout
**Category:** Identity and CPF
**File:** src/components/checkout/CheckoutForm.tsx:45-89
**Finding:** Checkout form collects name, email, address, and card details but no CPF field. CPF is required for any credit card transaction in Brazil.
**Fix:** Add a CPF input field (format: XXX.XXX.XXX-XX) with mod-11 checksum validation. Place it near the payment section. Use an input mask for auto-formatting.

### 3. No cookie consent mechanism
**Category:** Legal, Compliance, and LGPD
**File:** src/app/layout.tsx
**Finding:** No cookie consent banner, no consent management library, and no cookie preference storage found. The site loads Google Analytics, Meta Pixel, and Hotjar without consent. This violates LGPD.
**Fix:** Add a cookie consent banner with granular category controls (essential, analytics, marketing). Block non-essential scripts until consent is given.

## Warnings (Should Fix)

### 1. Currency formatted as USD
**Category:** Currency and Formatting
**File:** src/utils/formatPrice.ts:12
**Finding:** `formatPrice()` uses `Intl.NumberFormat('en-US', { style: 'currency', currency: 'USD' })`. Three components call this function: `ProductCard.tsx:34`, `CartSummary.tsx:67`, `CheckoutTotal.tsx:22`.
**Fix:** Change locale to `pt-BR` and currency to `BRL`. Output should be R$ 1.299,90 format.

### 2. No installment display on product pages
**Category:** Payments
**File:** src/components/product/ProductPrice.tsx:18
**Finding:** Product price component only renders the full price. No installment breakdown shown. Brazilian shoppers expect to see "12x de R$ XX,XX sem juros" alongside the full price.
**Fix:** Add installment calculation below the price. Show the monthly amount and whether interest-free.

### 3. No Reclame Aqui reference
**Category:** Trust Signals
**File:** (not found)
**Finding:** No reference to "Reclame Aqui" or "reclameaqui" found anywhere in the codebase. Reclame Aqui is the most important trust signal in Brazilian e-commerce.
**Fix:** Add your Reclame Aqui rating or link in the footer. If you don't have a Reclame Aqui page yet, create one.

### 4. CNPJ not displayed
**Category:** Trust Signals
**File:** src/components/layout/Footer.tsx:12-45
**Finding:** Footer contains company name, copyright, and social media links but no CNPJ.
**Fix:** Add your CNPJ (format: XX.XXX.XXX/XXXX-XX) to the footer component.

### 5. WhatsApp contact missing
**Category:** Communication and WhatsApp
**File:** src/components/layout/Header.tsx:8, src/pages/contact.tsx:15
**Finding:** Header has email and phone icons. Contact page lists email and a contact form. No WhatsApp link found anywhere.
**Fix:** Add a WhatsApp contact button using the wa.me/[number] link format.

### 6. No boleto payment option
**Category:** Payments
**File:** src/lib/payments/gateway.ts:23
**Finding:** Only credit card payment configured via Stripe. No boleto bancario option.
**Fix:** Add boleto via a Brazilian payment gateway. Include clear messaging about expiration (3-5 days) and processing time (1-3 business days).

### 7. European Portuguese detected in copy
**Category:** Copy and Tone
**File:** src/i18n/pt.json:145
**Finding:** Line 145 uses "contacto" (European Portuguese). Brazilian Portuguese uses "contato". Also found "telemovel" on line 203 (should be "celular") and "autocarro" on line 287 (should be "onibus").
**Fix:** Review pt.json for European Portuguese conventions. Have a native Brazilian Portuguese speaker review the full file.

### 8. Date format uses MM/DD/YYYY
**Category:** Currency and Formatting
**File:** src/utils/formatDate.ts:8
**Finding:** `formatDate()` outputs dates as MM/DD/YYYY (US format). Brazil uses DD/MM/YYYY.
**Fix:** Change date formatting to DD/MM/YYYY for the pt-BR locale.

### 9. No CEP auto-fill
**Category:** Forms and Data Collection
**File:** src/components/checkout/AddressForm.tsx:30-75
**Finding:** Address form has a CEP field but no auto-fill integration. Users must manually enter street, neighborhood, city, and state.
**Fix:** Integrate the ViaCEP API (free). When user enters CEP, auto-populate street, bairro, city, and state.

### 10. No account deletion mechanism
**Category:** Legal, Compliance, and LGPD
**File:** src/pages/account/settings.tsx:20-80
**Finding:** Account settings allows password change and email update but no option to delete account or request data deletion. LGPD requires this.
**Fix:** Add a "Delete my account" flow or a "Request data deletion" link.

### 11. Phone number not accepted as account identifier
**Category:** SMS and Verification
**File:** src/lib/auth/providers.ts:5-20
**Finding:** Signup and login flows are email-only. Many Brazilians are phone-first. Phone number login or signup is not supported.
**Fix:** Add phone number as an alternative account identifier for signup and login.

## Manual Review Checklist

These items require human judgment and can't be fully verified from code alone:

- [ ] December/Christmas promotional content uses summer imagery (not snow/winter)
- [ ] Brand's Reclame Aqui page is actively monitored and has a good rating
- [ ] Customer support team includes Portuguese-speaking agents on WhatsApp
- [ ] Installment pricing model accounts for interest absorption costs
- [ ] Portuguese copy reads naturally to a native Brazilian speaker (beyond the European PT issues flagged above)
- [ ] Physical address in footer is a real, verifiable Brazilian address

---

## Additional Observations

- **Signup flow asks for "Company Name" but not CNPJ.** For B2B sales in Brazil, CNPJ is the standard business identifier. Collecting it at signup signals legitimacy and also lets you issue nota fiscal to business customers. (`src/components/auth/SignupForm.tsx:34`)

- **Referral flow has WhatsApp sharing but it's buried.** The WhatsApp share button exists in `ShareModal.tsx` but it's the third option after email and "Copy Link." In Brazil, WhatsApp should be the first and most prominent sharing option. (`src/components/referral/ShareModal.tsx:25`)

- **Search bar placeholder says "Search products..." in English.** The i18n file has a Portuguese translation but the component has a hardcoded English fallback that appears briefly before hydration. (`src/components/search/SearchBar.tsx:12`)

- **Order confirmation page doesn't mention nota fiscal.** After purchase, Brazilian customers expect to receive a nota fiscal (electronic invoice tied to their CPF). The confirmation page should either provide it or explain when it will be sent. The nota fiscal generation logic exists (`src/lib/checkout/invoice.ts`) but is not surfaced to the user. (`src/pages/order/confirmation.tsx`)

- **Contact form doesn't include phone number field.** The contact page form collects name, email, and message. Brazilian users will likely just close the form and look for a WhatsApp number instead. (`src/pages/contact.tsx:30`)

- **Stripe is the only payment gateway.** While Stripe technically supports some Brazilian payment methods, its Brazil support is limited compared to local gateways. Card decline rates through foreign acquirers are significantly higher. Consider migrating to Pagarme, Stone, or Mercado Pago for the Brazilian market. (`src/lib/payments/gateway.ts:23`)
